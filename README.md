# Product Voting App
- This is a small React app where you can see a list of products and vote is shown.
When we click the Upvote button, the productâ€™s vote count goes up, and the list automatically reorders so that the most popular products are shown first.

 ## What it does
 - Shows a list of products with images, titles, and descriptions.
- Each product has a vote count.
- We can click Upvote to give it more votes.
- Products with more votes move to the top of the list.
